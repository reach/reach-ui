# Welcome to Reach UI Development ♿️

Thanks for getting involved with Reach UI development!

## Looking for the documentation?

https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/

## Getting Started

Reach UI is built and tested with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Please follow their [install instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) to get Yarn installed on your system.

Then, run these commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:reach/reach-ui.git
cd reach-ui
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Root Repo Scripts:

```sh
yarn build        # builds all packages
yarn start        # starts storybook server
yarn test         # runs tests in all packages
```

## Running / Writing Examples

First do the steps in "Getting started", then start the Storybook server:

```
yarn start
```

Next, put a file in `packages/<component-dir>/examples/<name>.example.js` and make it look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";

// The name of the example (always name the variable `name`)
let name = "Basic";

// The example to render (always name the function `Example`)
function Example() {
  return <div>Cool cool cool</div>;
}

// Assign the name to the example and then export it as a named constant
Example.story = { name };
export const Comp = Example;

// Default export an object with the title matching the name of the Reach package
export default { title: "Dialog" };
```

Now you can edit the files in `packages/*` and storybook will automatically reload your changes.

**Note**: If you change an internal dependency you will need to run `yarn build` again. For example, if working on `MenuButton` requires a change to `Rect` (an internal dependency of `MenuButton`), you will need to run `yarn build` for the changes to `Rect` to show up in your `MenuButton` example.

## Running / Writing Tests

First do the steps in "Getting Started", then:

```
yarn test
```

Or if you want to run the tests as you edit files:

```
yarn test --watch
```

Often you'll want to just test the component you're working on:

```
cd packages/<component-path>
yarn test --watch
```

## Development Plans

The components to be built come from the the [Aria Practices Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1). Here is a table of the components and their status.

## Releases

This is our current release process. It's not perfect, but it has almost the right balance of manual + automation for me. We might be able to put some of this in a script...

```sh
# First, run the build locally and make sure there are no problems
# and that all the tests pass:
$ yarn build
$ yarn test

# Generate the changelog and copy it somewhere for later. We'll
# automate this part eventually, but for now you can get the changelog
# with:
$ yarn changes

# Then create a new version and git tag locally. Don't push yet!
$ yarn ver [version]

# Take a look around and make sure everything is as you'd expect.
# You can inspect everything from the commit that lerna made with:
$ git log -p

# If something needs to be changed, you can undo the commit and
# delete the tag that lerna created and try again.

# If everything looks good, push to GitHub along with the new tag:
$ git push origin master --follow-tags

# Open up travis-ci.com/reach/reach-ui and watch the build. There will
# be 2 builds, one for the push to the master branch and one for the
# new tag. The tag build will run the build and all the tests and then
# automatically publish to npm if everything passes. If there's a
# problem, we have to figure out how to fix manually.

# Paste the changelog into the release on GitHub. The release is
# complete … huzzah!
```

You need to be careful when publishing a new package because the `lerna publish` on Travis CI will fail for new packages. To get around this, you should publish a `0.0.0` version of the package manually ahead of time. Then the release from CI will be ok. This is really janky but AFAICT the only workaround.

Stuff I'd like to improve:

- Automate changelog generation and GitHub release from CI
- Document how we're using GitHub PRs to generate the changelog somewhere

## Website

The website is a Gatsby app in the `website` directory. It automatically deploys to https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/ when the `website` branch is updated.
