# Contributing to Reach UI

Reach UI is built and tested with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Please follow their [install instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) to get Yarn installed on your system.

Then, run these commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:reach/reach-ui.git
cd reach-ui
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Root Repo Scripts:

```sh
yarn build        # builds all packages

yarn start        # starts storybook server

yarn test         # runs tests in all packages

yarn release      # publishes changed packages
```

## `website` directory scripts

The website uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) v2 with [Gatsby MDX](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx) powering most of the pages. It is deployed with [now](https://now.sh)

```
yarn build        # builds the production site to "public/"

yarn start        # starts the website

yarn stage        # deploys the site with now.sh

yarn deploy       # alias the latest deploy to production
```

## Running / Writing Examples

First do the steps in "Getting started", then start the Storybook server:

```
yarn start
```

Next, put a file in `packages/<component-dir>/examples/<name>.example.js` and make it look like this:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

// The name of the example (always name the variable `name`)
let name = "Basic";

// The example to render (always name the function `Example`)
function Example() {
  return <div>Cool cool cool</div>;
}

// Assign the name to the example and then export it as a named constant
Example.story = { name };
export const Comp = Example;

// Default export an object with the title matching the name of the Reach package
export default { title: "Dialog" };
```

Now you can edit the files in `packages/*` and storybook will automatically reload your changes.

**Note**: If you change an internal dependency you will need to run `yarn build` again. For example, if working on `MenuButton` requires a change to `Rect` (an internal dependency of `MenuButton`), you will need to run `yarn build` for the changes to `Rect` to show up in your `MenuButton` example.

## Running / Writing Tests

First do the steps in "Getting Started", then:

```
yarn test
```

Or if you want to run the tests as you edit files:

```
yarn test --watch
```

Often you'll want to just test the component you're working on:

```
cd packages/<component-path>
yarn test --watch
```
