# @reach/polymorphic

## 0.18.0-pre.5

## 0.18.0-pre.4

### Minor Changes

- All `Polymorphic` types that were previously exported from `@reach/utils` have been moved to a separate package `@reach/polymorphic`. As `@reach/utils` is an internal package, this [breaking] change should not affect you [if you listened to us and did not use the package directly].
