# Reach UI

Reach UI seeks to become the accessible foundation of your React-based design system.

You can get involved by:

- Joining the [Spectrum Community](https://spectrum.chat/reach)
- Following on [GitHub](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui)

Each component is tested with Safari + VoiceOver, Firefox + NVDA, and Edge + JAWS. As the project matures weâ€™ll get it audited by WebAIM to ensure that if you pick Reach UI, your app has a solid, accessible foundation.

Development of Reach UI is funded by [online courses](https://reach.tech/courses) and [workshops](https://reacttraining.com/workshops/) provided by [the React Training team](https://reacttraining.com/training/).

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Styling Guide](/styling)
2. Read the docs for a component, how about the [MenuButton](/menu-button)?
3. Many of the examples in the docs are interactive, so go ahead and tinker!
