# Auto ID

Autogenerate IDs to facilitate WAI-ARIA and server rendering.

A string can be supplied as an argument to be used in lieu of the auto-generated ID. This is handy for accepting user-provided prop IDs that need to be deterministic.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @reach/auto-id
# or
yarn add @reach/auto-id
```

## Usage

```js
import { useId } from "@reach/auto-id";

// Pass in a user-supplied ID that will be used conditionally if provided
const id = useId(props.id);
```
