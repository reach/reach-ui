A disclosure is a button that controls visibility of a panel of content. When the content inside the panel is hidden, it is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content. When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down.

If you have a group of disclosures that stack vertically and exist within the same logical context, you may want to use [`@reach/accordion`](/accordion) instead.

## Installation

From the command line in your project directory, run `npm install @reach/disclosure` or `yarn add @reach/disclosure`. Then import the components that you need:

```bash
npm install @reach/disclosure
# or
yarn add @reach/disclosure
```

```js
import {
  Disclosure,
  DisclosureButton,
  DisclosurePanel
} from "@reach/disclosure";
```

## Usage

```jsx
// jsx-demo
function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureButton>Find out what lies beneath</DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel>Here I am! I am the buried treasure!</DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  );
}
```

## Component API

### Disclosure

The wrapper component and context provider for a disclosure's button and panel components. A disclosure should only have one button and one panel descendant.

```jsx
<Disclosure>
  <DisclosureButton>Do a thing</DisclosureButton>
  <DisclosurePanel>...</DisclosurePanel>
</Disclosure>
```

It is important to note that the `Disclosure` component doesn't actually render a DOM node, so there is no way to add styles to a disclosure wrapper directly. If you want your disclosure to have a wrapper element you can nest one directly.

```jsx
<Disclosure>
  <div style={{ padding: 10 }}>
    <DisclosureButton>Do a thing</DisclosureButton>
    <DisclosurePanel>...</DisclosurePanel>
  </div>
</Disclosure>
```

#### Controlled Disclosure

If you want to control the disclosure's value, you can do so by passing [`open`](#disclosure-open) and [`onChange`](#disclosure-onchange) props.

```jsx
const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);
return (
  <Disclosure open={isOpen} onChange={() => setOpen(!isOpen)}>
    <DisclosureButton />
    <DisclosurePanel />
  </Disclosure>
);
```

#### Disclosure Props

| Prop                                   | Type                 | Required | Default |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| [children](#disclosure-children)       | `node`               | true     |         |
| [defaultOpen](#disclosure-defaultopen) | `boolean`            | false    | `false` |
| [id](#disclosure-id)                   | `string` \| `number` | false    |         |
| [onChange](#disclosure-onchange)       | `func`               | false    |         |
| [open](#disclosure-open)               | `boolean`            | false    | `false` |

##### Disclosure children

_Type_: `node`

`Disclosure` expects to receive accept `DisclosureButton` and `DisclosurePanel` components as either direct children or descendants. It can also accept wrapper elements if desired, though it is not recommended to pass other arbitrary components within a disclosure in most cases.

```jsx
<div>
  {/* OK! */}
  <Disclosure>
    <DisclosureButton>Click Me</DisclosureButton>
    <DisclosurePanel>Collapse or open this content!</DisclosurePanel>
  </Disclosure>

  {/* Also OK! */}
  <Disclosure>
    <div>
      <DisclosureButton>Click Me</DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel>Collapse or open this content!</DisclosurePanel>
    </div>
  </Disclosure>

  {/* Probably confusing, you should avoid! */}
  <Disclosure>
    <div>Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, blah blah blah</div>
    <DisclosureButton>Click Me</DisclosureButton>
    <DisclosurePanel>Collapse or open this content!</DisclosurePanel>
    <blockquote>You miss 100% of the shots you don't take</blockquote>
  </Disclosure>
</div>
```

##### Disclosure defaultOpen

_Type_: `boolean`
_Default_: `false`

Whether or not an uncontrolled disclosure component should default to its `open` state on the initial render.

##### Disclosure id

_Type_: `string | number`

An id used to assign aria and id attributes to nested `DisclosureButton` and `DisclosurePanel` components.

Since the Disclosure component itself does not render a DOM element, an `id` prop will not appear in the DOM directly as may be expected. Rather, we need to generate IDs for the panel and button based on a disclosure ID for aria compliance. If no `id` is passed we will generate descendant IDs for you.

```jsx
<Disclosure id="awesome-disclosure">
  <div>
    {" "}
    {/* no ID passed here! */}
    <DisclosureButton /> {/* <button id="awesome-disclosure--button" /> */}
    <DisclosurePanel /> {/* <div id="awesome-disclosure--panel" /> */}
  </div>
</Disclosure>
```

##### Disclosure onChange

_Type_: `func: () => void`

The callback that is fired when a disclosure's open state is changed.

##### Disclosure open

_Type_: `func: () => void`

The controlled open state of the disclosure. The `open` prop should be used along with `onChange` to create controlled disclosure components.

```jsx
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
return (
  <Disclosure open={open} onChange={() => setOpen(!open)}>
    <DisclosureButton>I have a secret</DisclosureButton>
    <DisclosurePanel>
      Ante rhoncus facilisis iaculis nostra faucibus vehicula ac consectetur
      pretium, lacus nunc consequat id viverra facilisi ligula eleifend, congue
      gravida malesuada proin scelerisque luctus est convallis.
    </DisclosurePanel>
  </Disclosure>
);
```

### DisclosureButton

The trigger button a user clicks to interact with a disclosure.

#### DisclosureButton Props

| Prop                                   | Type   | Required | Default |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| [children](#disclosurebutton-children) | `node` | true     |         |

##### DisclosureButton children

Typically a text string that serves as a label for the disclosure button, though nested DOM nodes can be passed as well so long as they are valid children of interactive elements.

### DisclosurePanel

The collapsible panel in which inner content for a disclosure item is rendered.

#### DisclosurePanel Props

| Prop                                  | Type   | Required | Default |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| [children](#disclosurepanel-children) | `node` | true     |         |

##### DisclosurePanel children

_Type_: `node`

Inner collapsible content for the disclosure item.
